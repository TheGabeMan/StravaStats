Get your Strava Stats level into Home Assistant

First attempt to write an integration for Home Assistant. 
As I'm training for a big event, I wanted to see my training progress. Programs like Strava, Elevate for Strava, Training Peaks and Intervals.cu show your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ATL) and Form (TSB) per day. In this way you can see your progress and wether you are training to hard or not enough.

As a gimmick I wanted to try to show these values in Home Assistant as well. Now, here it is.... my first integration that shows you these values.

There is still a lot to be done. I want to add more data later on.

To do:
- instructions on how to get strava's client id, client secret key and token.
- create graph from data
- add more metrics like rides, distance, etc
